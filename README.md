# bme688-devkit-mount

Initial f3d file and stl available for testing.
Mounts on the left-y gantry extrusion on a voron 2.4. 
On the huzzah32 board I have, the wifi antenna partially covers the mounting holes. This is why I have chosen to create support legs on one side, rather than screw holes. 2 screw holes should be sufficient.
